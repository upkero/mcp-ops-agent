    Extracted here (DRY) so every outbound call — HTTP to ops-core-api, and any
    future external call — shares one retry/backoff policy instead of hand-rolling
    loops. Only ``retry_on`` exception types are retried; anything else propagates
    immediately. After ``attempts`` failures the last exception is re-raised.

    Sleeps ``base_delay * 2**n`` between attempts (n = 0-based retry index), unless
    ``delay_for`` returns a value for the raised exception — used to honour a
    server-provided ``Retry-After`` without teaching this util about HTTP.
