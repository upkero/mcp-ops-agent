"""Pin the error codes this service shares with ops-core-api.

`tests/fixtures/error-codes.json` is a manual copy of ops-core-api's generated
`docs/error-codes.json`. Refreshing it stays manual, but a *test* now fails when
it goes stale, instead of a client discovering the rename in production.

This service has no `_ERROR_CODES` map: `gateways/ops_core/base.py` switches on the
upstream's HTTP status, never on its error code, so there is nothing here that
silently mis-parses a renamed one. What it does share is the vocabulary itself — a
caller handling `invalid_api_key` from ops-core-api must get the same string from
us — so that is what is asserted. `ops_core_unavailable` and `ops_core_not_found`
are deliberately absent: those are this service's own codes describing its view of
the upstream, not the upstream's codes.
